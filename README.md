# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Sai Krishna Prashanth Kolluru

**Data Scientist, ML Engineer, GenAI Engineer, NLP**

I build end-to-end AI systems that create measurable value. From solid data pipelines and predictive models to agentic LLM solutions in the cloud, I ship ML that is reliable, explainable, and production-ready.

## üíº Snapshot
- **Cognizant, Data Scientist, 2021‚Äì2023**: designed Azure Databricks ingestion for 20+ bank feeds, time-series forecasting with rolling MAPE under 10%, containerized on AKS with MLflow, added observability with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.  
- **Research and Publications**: peer-reviewed ANN optimization for materials and manufacturing, Best Paper at ICE3MT-22 for erosive wear modeling.

## üß† What I Do
- **Agentic AI in the Cloud**: design and deploy LLM agents with tool use, planning, and memory on **AWS Bedrock**/**Azure AI Foundry**, orchestrate with **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, **Semantic Kernel**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, add retrieval (RAG), evaluation loops, and safety guardrails.  
- **Production grade ML Systems**: feature stores and ETL, model selection and hyperparameter tuning, CI/CD, containerization, online inference, A/B testing, drift and bias monitoring with robust logging and alerts.  
- **Applied NLP**: multilingual pipelines, classification, NER, sentiment, topic modeling, summarization, conversational AI, semantic search with embeddings.  
- **Forecasting and Analytics**: statistical time series (ARIMA, SARIMA) and ML methods for demand, capacity, and risk, paired with decision-ready dashboards.
